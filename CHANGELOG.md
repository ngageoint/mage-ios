## [2.0.2](https://github.com/ngageoint/mage-ios/releases/tag/2.0.2) (04-18-2018)

##### Release Notes

Tired of burning your retinas while using MAGE at night or in a dark area?  MAGE now comes with a wonderful night theme.  Sometimes, users would log in without a connection and immediately be logged out as soon as the app would regain connection.  How rude.  Now when you are logged in without a connection to the server, you will be notified and allowed to log in from the settings screen when you have a connection again.  MAGE will no longer log you out when a connection is obtained, however, before you see any updates from your team, and before your local updates are sent to them, you will need to log in again.  Also, bug fixes.  Found them all this time...

##### Features

* Themes: Currently support day and night themes
* Disconnected login has been improved to give the user more feedback
* Additions for login.gov

##### Bug Fixes

* Fixes case where an observation was being edited when the user logged out and then changed their server.
* Attachment cell constraint fix
* Observation markers are not dropped multiple times when an observation is created
* Apple maps URL fixed for case with primary fields with spaces
* You can now cancel adding a voice recording
* Fixes case where connection is lost before events are pulled

* Lat/Lng edit text fields added to geometry edit view, users can now manually enter a lat/lng
* Allow avatar edit from profile view.
* Added cancel button to sign up view
* Reworked how we handle media permissions.  Ask for permissions (gallery, camera, mic) before the OS asks.  In this case when the user
  performs an action like 'attach a photo' the app will check for permissions and ask the user.  If permission has been denied the app
  will present a 'link' to MAGE settings to allow the users to change the permission.
* Don't show unknown form fields.  This will help with backwards compatibility, as we won't have to worry what the client will do
  with form fields it does not know how to handle.'
* Pull thumbnails for attachments.  All image attachments will ask for thumbnail from the server, which greatly improves performance.
* Add time based filtering.

##### Bug Fixes

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/ngageoint/mage-ios/releases/tag/1.0.0) (06-14-2016)
